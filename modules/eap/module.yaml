description: Module to install base EAP layer to the RH-SSO container image

# NOTE:
#
#   The former listing of all specific EAP modules to be included into the RH-SSO
#   images was replaced with a single 'setup.eap.modules' CEKit module (therefore
#   one new layer in the resulting built container image).
#
#   This single module combines / concatenates the functionality of all necessary
#   EAP modules, listed in the 'used-eap-modules-list.txt' in this directory, and
#   respects the internal dependencies between those modules. IOW the prerequisite
#   EAP modules are listed before the modules, which depend on them.
#
#   This approach was chosen to avoid / overcome the 'max depth exceeded' OSBS
#   container build system error message, which got triggered previously by
#   performing an OSBS build, listing the necessary specific EAP modules
#   one-by-one. Due to the high number of EAP modules, needed to be included,
#   there were too many layers in the intermediary image, and the OSBS build
#   failed as a whole.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
#   Do not change this approach!
#
#   If you need to add / list additional EAP module, not present yet, append the
#   list of artifacts, environment variables, labels (basically all the
#   information listed in 'module.yaml' file of the new module, you want to add)
#   at the appropriate section of 'module.yaml' file of the existing
#   'setup.eap.modules' module (for example append the labels from the new module
#   at the end of 'labels' section of 'setup.eap.modules' module, so the labels
#   from the new module are known to 'setup.eap.modules' module too.
#
#   Moreover, copy the body of the configure script of that new module at the
#   appropriate place of the existing 'configure.sh' script. For each of the
#   already included configuration scripts, the 'configure.sh' script contains
#   the starting and ending comments, so the order in which the modules need
#   to be included, is preserved and respected.

modules:
      install:
          - name: setup.eap.modules
